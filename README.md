### Hi there 👋, I'm Semih Yemişci

#### 🧠 Backend Developer | Fullstack Mindset | .NET Core Specialist

I'm Semih from Turkey — a backend developer with 3+ years of professional experience in .NET Core stack. I love solving real-world problems, building scalable APIs, and designing clean architecture systems.

Currently, I’m working as a fullstack developer at AifTeam. My focus is mainly on backend with .NET Core, EF Core, and SQL Server, but I also build frontend projects with React and sometimes Flutter.

### 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🧠 Backend: `.NET Core`, `EF Core`, `ASP.NET API`, `LINQ`, `ADO.NET`
- 💾 Databases: `SQL Server`, `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB`
- 🌐 Frontend: `React.js`, `Flutter`, `JavaScript`
- ☁️ DevOps: `Docker`, `CI/CD`, `Git`, `Azure`, `Firebase`
- 📦 Others: `SOLID Principles`, `Clean Architecture`, `RESTful APIs`, `JWT`, `CQRS`

### 🚀 What I'm Doing Now

- Developing scalable backend systems using `.NET Core`, `EF Core`, and `PostgreSQL`
- Architecting RESTful APIs with clean layering and domain-driven design (DDD)
- Refactoring legacy systems to modern architectures (CQRS, Repository Pattern, etc.)
- Working with high-traffic production systems, handling performance and optimization
- Integrating third-party services (ERP, payment gateways, external APIs)
- Building AI-powered features on top of existing APIs (FastAPI backend + AI models)
- Occasionally creating fullstack prototypes using React or Flutter
